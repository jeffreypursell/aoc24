7,5: cdv(5)
  reg[2] = reg[0] / 2.pow(reg[1])
0,3: adv(3)
  reg[0] /= 8
1,4: bxl(4)
  reg[1] ^= 4
4,7: bxc(7)

5,5: out(5)
  yield reg[1] % 8
3,0: jnz(0)
  if reg[0] != 0 {
    goto 0
  }

while reg[0] != 0 {
  reg[1] = reg[0] % 8;
  reg[1] ^= 3;
  reg[2] = reg[0] / 2.pow(reg[1])
  reg[0] /= 8
  reg[1] ^= 4
  reg[1] ^= reg[2]
  yield reg[1] % 8
}

what if we ran it backwards? the output comes from register[1] and we know what
that should be modulo 8, so we could just set that maybe. Then set the other
registers to 0 I guess and see what you end up with after it eats all the
"output" in reverse.

I tried making reverse unit tests and the cdv(5) seems to be non-reversable, so
maybe I need to look at the program as a whole and try to reverse it.

Ok, looking at the above program some more, I can see that it just chunks
through reg[0] 3 bits at a time. The output is mostly a function of the last 3
bits of reg[0] except for the line

    reg[2] = reg[0] / 2.pow(reg[1])

where we are right shifting reg[0] by the amount in reg[1] and assigning that to
reg[2]. That will contain bits from higher up in reg[0], then in this line

    reg[1] ^= reg[2]

We will be effectivly using the last 3 bits of reg[2] to flip our output bits.

So how do we figure out which 3 bits come from above?

We shift reg[0] by (reg[0] % 8) ^ 3

0 -> 3
1 -> 2
2 -> 1
3 -> 0
4 -> 7
5 -> 6
6 -> 5
7 -> 4

So if the last 3 bits or reg[0] end in a 4, we are shifting it all the way over 7 bits.


...

OK so I think what you do is solve it 3 bits at a time in reverse order.

The program ends in 0 so the input that produces a single 0 is 7

So 7 is the last 3 bits to get fed in so the number starts with 7 * 2.pow(15 * 3)

but to solve the second number you find something that starts with 0b111 and 
then try all the 8 possibilities for the last 3 bits and make sure it matches the
second to last number: 3

so after you find each number you multiply by 8 and try adding 0..=7 to match
the nth from the end number
